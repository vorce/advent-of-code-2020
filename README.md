# Advent of Code 2020

Solving some [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems with Elixir.

For fun only. Not trying to make the solutions super fast, or super pretty. There will be tests though.

## Notes

- Day 13, part 2. Too hard for me, only "solved" by looking at other's code.
- Day 14, part 2. Bad solution that is very slow. But it works! :D
